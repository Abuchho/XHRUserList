
// On page load, pull the users endpoint from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users using XHR
// Generate the table of users for #usersTable (include a button/link in the fourth column to let you view an individual record)
// If a button/link in the table is clicked, populate #userView with the full details of the user.
// (bonus points if you make it a nice form as if the user was editable)
